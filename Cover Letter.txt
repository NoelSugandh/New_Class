Hello,

I trust this email finds you well. I recently came across the email regarding the available GA positions and I am keen to express my interest in the infotech GA position. Having recently concluded my tenure as a lab supervisor at Idealab, where I gained valuable experience.

My background encompasses a diverse skill set, including proficiency in 3D printing, badge making, machine building, calibration, and coding. These experiences have equipped me with the ability to tackle challenges effectively and contribute meaningfully to projects.

I have attached my resume and a reference from Altis, Michael L. , Makerspace Manager, Sacred Heart University . Additionally, I have included my class schedule for the Late Spring 2024 semester.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my skills and experiences align with the requirements of the position.

Warm regards,

Noel Sugandh Motupalli,
